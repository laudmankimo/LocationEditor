###locationEditor

---
**locationEditor** is an iOS placemarks editor, which is designed to easily integrate into any LBS, or navigation software, it get best user experience on **iOS 5.0/5.0.1/5.1, and 5.1.1**, in iOS 6 the built-in Mapkit changed to Apple Map, not only the map loading speed slows down, but also google direction service does not match the Apple's Map, and forward geodecoding (address string to coordinate) works terrible, I suggest you don't upgrade your device to iOS 6+, if you have interest in location/navigation based software development.



###Status

---

I dunno how to write this field 0.0", currently this software works fine, except user tap a saved address in the UITableView, what to do when user tapped the row is decide by you, it's **NONE** of my business.

###Short-term goals

---

* ---add UISearchBar to filter saved placemarks.--- ........................done
* add POI(Point Of Interests) search function (utilize google POI database) near your current location, such as 'McDonalds' in the UISearchBar

###Long-term goals

---

* Add google map iOS SDK support, more easility to integrate MapNavigationDemo, my another personal navigation open source project.
